# memeMe
The MemeMe App as part of my portfolio in the completion of my iOS Nanodegree at Udacity

The app allows users to select an image (or use a new image from the camera) and add text to the bottom and top of the image.

Users can then share the new 'Meme' with themselves via email or on their public social accounts.


To run this program you will need to create an ApiKeys.plist in the Supporting Files group:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>FLICKR_PUBLIC_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PUBLIC_FLICKR_KEY</string>
	<key>FLICKR_SECRET_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PRIVATE_FLICKR_KEY</string>
</dict>
</plist>
